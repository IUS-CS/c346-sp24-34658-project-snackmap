# Design Patterns 

SnackMap currently utilizes the Factory Method.

Design patterns that may fit well into our design includes Prototype, Builder, and Singleton.

In the future we plan to continue to use the Factory method. We also plan to use Prototype for front end design. The use of Singleton and Factory is planed for back end design.
