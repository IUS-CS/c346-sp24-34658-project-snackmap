# Proposal

SnackMap aims to solve the problem of students being able to find food on Indiana University Southeast’s campus. 

What can feel like a never-ending search for a snack in between classes can be easily solved with the SnackMap.  

The SnackMap tracks the vending machines’ and IU Eats Grab and Go inventory, and the times of openings for the food courts on campus. 

Our intention is to help students find food and drinks when they are on campus. 

# Vision Statement

For those on Indiana University Southeast’s campus who need quick and easy access to food. 
The SnackMap is a digital real-time catalog that logs the food and drink options on Indiana University Southeast’s campus. Unlike VendSoft our product is for use by the consumer and not the owner of the vending machines.
