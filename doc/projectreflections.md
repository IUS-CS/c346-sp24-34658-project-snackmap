# Project Reflections

This project offered a lot of learning opportunities and was a great experience in developing software. I was able to further develop my time management skills having to balance this semester long project, a second semester long project, normal school work, work, and my life outside of school/work. I enjoyed learning how to collaborate well on a project using Github. Before this, most of my experience on Github was from solo assignments. It was also a great way to get knowledge working with dart and VSCode. I had previously used VSCode exclusively for markdown assignments.
Our tasks included brainstorming project ideas, completing sprint ceremonies, and assigning tasks. Our first few meetings were spent on coming up with a project idea and what we wanted that idea to look like. When each sprint ended, we filled out a Sprint Ceremony. We discussed what went good/bad, things we wanted to do better at as a group, and decided on more ideas to implement during the next sprint. Before starting on the next sprint, we would assign tasks for each member to complete. And the process repeated.
###Meetings/Discussions: 
To work effectively as a team, it was necessary for us to discuss the visions of this project and the details of the code being implemented. While meeting after class gave us sufficient time to discuss, having a server dedicated to the project made it easy to organize materials/discussions about SnackMap. It provided an easy way to ask questions outside of meetings and to give updates on our progress.
###Writing Code: 
When working on the code it was important to discuss with each other throughout the process. This ensured that everyone knew how each file connected and understood the general workings of the application. I tried to maintain a level of consistency in style with my other group member’s code, especially for classes that were meant to perform similar tasks (for example, the classes SearchByLocation and SearchByPrice). This was done by examining the code, discussing the code, and ensuring I understood what it accomplished.
###Testing:
As we have learned in this course and throughout college, it is important to test as you go when writing code. Some of the tests I performed are unit tests implemented in the application. I also performed ‘print debugging’ tests to ensure the lists contained the correct information as I was working on the code. The print debugging is no longer written in the code as it has served its purpose.

My experience with this project was a challenging but overall good one. I learned how to use Github with others. I also learned how to organize work and make a detailed plan to meet both sprint and end of project deadlines. The types of task I have done include planning backlog, assigning story points, design, programming, and testing.
As part of the planning process our group had to discuss what exactly we want our idea to do and how to do it. We also had to discuss how to organize the backlog and which story point to do when so that all goals could be met with the least amount of lost sleep. 
The project our group chose has a lot of front end. A good GUI need to be user friendly and part of that is thinking about the design of the GUI. We had to think about how a user could type out what is needed but would it be better for them to select it. I also though about how color can make a good GUI.
This project is not possible without code. I worked on parts of the code for options_drawer.dart, price_page.dart, search_by_price_page.dart, update_vending_page.dart, vending_data_fields.dart, vending_machine_data_sheet_api.dart. These parts of code where for both frontend and backend. The most challenging task was setting up and writing the code for the user to be able to update vending machine data. This was the most challenging because Flutter and Dart have limitations and features that have to be worked around. The why to do this was setting up an API. 
Testing is a very important part of programming. I tested both frontend and backend code. To test the backend code unit test were created. For the frontend as it called on the backend code was test both through the backend and through physical testing to see how the user would interact with the code. This allowed me to test the code the same way the user would see it. 
Overall my types of test involved planning, design, and programming.
