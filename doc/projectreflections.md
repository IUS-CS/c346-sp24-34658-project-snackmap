My experience with this project was a challenging but overall good one. I learned how to use Github with others. I also learned how to organize work and make a detailed plan to meet both sprint and end of project deadlines. The types of task I have done include planning backlog, assigning story points, design, programming, and testing.
As part of the planning process our group had to discuss what exactly we want our idea to do and how to do it. We also had to discuss how to organize the backlog and which story point to do when so that all goals could be met with the least amount of lost sleep. 
The project our group chose has a lot of front end. A good GUI need to be user friendly and part of that is thinking about the design of the GUI. We had to think about how a user could type out what is needed but would it be better for them to select it. I also though about how color can make a good GUI.
This project is not possible without code. I worked on parts of the code for options_drawer.dart, price_page.dart, search_by_price_page.dart, update_vending_page.dart, vending_data_fields.dart, vending_machine_data_sheet_api.dart. These parts of code where for both frontend and backend. The most challenging task was setting up and writing the code for the user to be able to update vending machine data. This was the most challenging because Flutter and Dart have limitations and features that have to be worked around. The why to do this was setting up an API. 
Testing is a very important part of programming. I tested both frontend and backend code. To test the backend code unit test were created. For the frontend as it called on the backend code was test both through the backend and through physical testing to see how the user would interact with the code. This allowed me to test the code the same way the user would see it. 
Overall my types of test involved planning, design, and programming.
